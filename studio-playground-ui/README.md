## SageMaker Studio - Generative AI Playground

## Overview
This solution will build a web interface to try out generative ai models deployed as sagemaker endpoints using Streamlit. It is an open-source python library which makes it easy to create and share web apps for ML and data science teams. 
We will leverage Amazon SageMaker Studio's fully integrated development environment (IDE) with Jupyter Lab 3, to build, run and serve Streamlit web apps within the same environment for development purposes. 

Note: This is a sample code, and not meant for production deployments.
